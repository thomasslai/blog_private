Required Plug-Ins:

Adding Members:

For now there is neither a clean method to add a member to the member list on the 'about us' page nor to create the members page on the other hand.

To add a member page do the following steps:
- 
- Retrieve the ID of the page
- Go to the header.php file and add the ID to the 'exclude' list in the Navbar to exclude the member page from being shown in the Navbar
- 

To add a member card to the 'about us' page do the following steps:
- Retrieve the ID of the member page
- add following code to the member div:
    <?php member_card( $member_first_name, $member_last_name, $page_id, $member_descr ); ?>
where you set the variables according to the member
- to add a picture, put the picture in the images folder of the theme and rename it as <members first name>.jpg
